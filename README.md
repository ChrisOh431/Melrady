This application's always been closed source, but since I'll be sunsetting it soon I reckoned I might as well open source it and clean up the code a bit.

## Why release it now?

I was planning to make it open after I had an MVP working, but goofed and committed the secret and client id codes Spotify gave me in a place gitignore wasn't keeping out. My bad. Won't happen again (I wasn't entirely knowledgable on how secret keys worked before.)

Since I feel the live deployment's had a good run (and I don't feel like paying server+domain fees,) I'll be removing it from the interweb, and leaving you lot to self-host (or do whatever with it.) So, I've made a new repo to prevent any secret key fiascos and placed the code here.

## Code Cleanup

I built this in a bit less than a month, while learning lots of new things about express and interacting with and making APIs, so it's not the code I'm proudest of. This is my opportunity to fix that.
